### To cancel is to dissolve or otherwise terminate contract requirements

A cancel request can be generated by either participant in confidentially registered and executed, Web3+ contract. Such cancel request is an attempt to remove themselves from the terms, conditions or responsibilities which were previously entered into during registration of DCG ecosystem or other forms of contractual documentation. For any number of rationales or reasons the request to cancel may be presented to DCG®, from or between SSDID owner-controllers who in-contract are themselves acting as registered participants.
