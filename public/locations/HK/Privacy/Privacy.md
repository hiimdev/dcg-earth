1. ## **INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE & HOW WE PROCESS IT**

In this Privacy Policy, “**Data**” collectively refers to Personal Data, Sensitive Personal Data and PII (as defined hereunder):

“**Personal Data**” shall mean any personally identifiable information relating to an identified or identifiable individual, including data that identifies an individual or that could be used to identify, locate, track, or contact an individual. Personal Data includes both directly identifiable information, such as name, identification number or unique job title, and indirectly identifiable information such as date of birth, unique mobile or wearable device identifier, information that could be used to identify a household, telephone number, key-coded data or online identifiers, such as IP addresses, and includes any data that constitutes “personal data” under the GDPR or similar terms under other Data Protection Law.

“**Sensitive Personal Data or Information**” with respect to a person shall mean such personal information which consists of information relating to:

- any detail relating to the above clauses as provided to us for providing the Services;
- any of the information received under above clauses by us for processing, stored or processed under lawful contract or otherwise;
- bio-metric information;
- financial information such as bank account or credit card or debit card or other payment instrument details;
- medical records and history;
- password;
- physical, physiological and mental health condition; and
- sexual orientation.

“**PII**” means your name, address, identification number, phone number, and includes any other information by which you may be personally identified.

Further, “**Data Protection Law**” shall mean any data protection, data security or privacy law, including, without limitation, the Information Technology Act, 2000, EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (the “**GDPR**“) and any laws governing Personal Data, Sensitive Personal Data or information from outbound telephone calls, transmission of electronic mail, transmission of facsimile messages and any other communication-related data protection, data security or privacy laws.

- In order to provide the Services to you and facilitate usage of the Platforms, we may collect, use, or disclose the following (set out below) data about you and/or process them in the manner described:

- Account Information: Throughout DCG Platform use, all DCG User Data is personally encrypted by the relevant User, and done so by their utilization of AES, RSA and PGP encryption protocols. DCG User must first register a mobile-device, or phone number, in order to activate and access a DCG account on the Platforms. Such phone numbers are stored and used to provide ongoing authorization of DCG Services. Users may further personally encrypt and then hold for control any PII. A Users’ encrypted PII data are then permitted to be decrypted for use by DCG, such as authorization of a third party service, only as and when such controlling User decides. All other display data, profile content or information as relating to a Users’ DCG account, such as a profile name and profile picture which the Users voluntarily upload, can be visible to Users’ DCG contacts.

- Direct Text or Messages: DCG does not hold nor at any time store any Users’ private encryption key(s). Therefore, DCG cannot decrypt or otherwise access any Users’ content, including their texts, calls or other forms of messages. DCG Services and servers only handle already encrypted data. As such, Users’ exchanges and/or communications do not appear as readable anywhere apart from the intended, authorized sender or recipient devices. User content, including message histories and photos as say shared in-chat, may be temporarily stored on the Users’ own devices. These too can easily be permanently deleted by the controlling User, through their accessing their installed DCG Application. DCG chats and calls can only be decrypted by the controller (sender) and recipient (receiver). Further, DCG allows immutable public or private blockchain-based data registrations.

- Direct Voice and Video Calls: DCG implements WebRTC as well as other advanced solutions for User-to-User voice and video calls. This solution permits an encrypted and direct, device-to-device, near real-time exchange. As DCG again does not hold nor at any time store any Users’ private encryption key(s), at no point is any unencrypted call information conveyed through DCG servers. DCG cannot decrypt or otherwise access any Users’ content, including their voice and video calls. DCG Services and servers only handle already encrypted data. As such, Users’ calls cannot be understood or intercepted by anyone apart from the intended, authorized participants in active exchange. DCG User call histories and contacts are encrypted and temporarily stored on Users’ own devices. These may easily be permanently deleted by the controlling User, through their accessing their installed DCG Application.

- Blockchain Registrations and User Ordered DLT Services: Additional content, data and or technical information is generated through user implementation of DCG DLT as well as varied blockchain services. These DCG DLT services include, but are not limited to, timestamps and permanent registrations or both data as well as multimedia. DCG implements a unique combination of private as well as public blockchain networks that are hosted both on DCG servers as well as across various decentralized, global networks. DCG automatically provides anonymous provenance history and data-audit capacities to authorized Users. Meaning subsequent and/or publicly available, essentially permanent, blockchain records themselves then only become decryptable for and/or shareable by the controlling User.

DCG generated or ascribed transactional specific data may include, but is not limited to, randomly generated authentication tokens, keys, push tokens and other digital materials or authorization indications set as necessary to permit DCG service utilization, invoice generation and the like. DCG limits this additional technical information to the minimum required to operate the Services.

- Contacts: DCG can be authorized to firstly discover a Users’ device-listed contacts, in the Users’ associated contact address book and to then identify which of those listed therein happen to be existing DCG Users. DCG Users’ contact information from a specific device, as authorized, is encrypted itself before undergoing a blind-matching digital process, so as to protect all details listed therein. Throughout the Users’ contact matching process, DCG does not store nor does DCG display on any server or location any unencrypted or readable User contact information.

- Help Desk and/or Technical Support: DCG permits Users to create in-Application ‘help tickets’. Anyone may further directly email {{mailContact}} at any time. Throughout either selected method of help-desk exchange, the Users’ personal data or information that may be shared is kept only temporarily retained in digital format, strictly for the administrative purposes of researching any identified scenario, event or issue and then subsequently following up directly with the relevant Parties about said case.

- Managing Conveyed Information: DCG Users must initially undergo personal encryption protocols (G-E2EE), with such encryption thereby covering and pertaining to all subsequent DCG associated Service-related data, content and/or varied forms of User or User-generated information. DCG Users’ profile information can be visible to their contacts. Direct exchanges between DCG Users are decryptable between said DCG Users’ as are in or have been in exchange. Whereas any unencrypted disclosures, Data or even blockchain registrations as have been or may be executed by a DCG User through any Service/Platform are done entirely under the sole responsibility, liability, benefit or detriment and personal choice of the relevant uploading User.

- Other than the information detailed in Clause 1.2 hereinabove, we may collect, use, or disclose the following information from you in order to provide the Services to you:

- information that you provide on the Platform while creating a DCG account, purchasing any Services on the Platforms or information/details provided by you on the Platforms which includes your Data and other information provided at the time of browsing the Platforms, registering to use the Platform and our Services, posting material or requesting further Services from us.
